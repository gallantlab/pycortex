===================
Upsample data from a lower resolution fsaverage template to fsaverage for visualization
===================

This example shows how data in a lower resolution fsaverage template 
(e.g., fsaverage5 or fsaverage6) can be upsampled to the high resolution fsaverage 
template for visualization.

    subject = "fsaverage"

    # First we check if the fsaverage template is already in the pycortex filestore. If not,
    # we download the template from the web and add it to the filestore.
    if subject not in cortex.db.subjects:
        cortex.download_subject(subject)

    # Next we create some data on fsaverage5. Each hemisphere has 10242 vertices.

    # We concatenate the data to itself to create a vector of length 20484, corresponding to
    # the two hemispheres together.
    data_fs5 = np.concatenate((data_fs5, data_fs5))
    # Finally, we upsample the data to fsaverage.
    data_fs7 = cortex.freesurfer.upsample_to_fsaverage(data_fs5, "fsaverage5")

    # Now that the data is in the fsaverage template, we can visualize it in PyCortex as any
