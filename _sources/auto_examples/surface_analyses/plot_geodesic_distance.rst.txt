===========================
Plotting Geodesic Distances
===========================

This plots the distances (in mm) between a vertex or set of vertices and
all other vertices on a surface. These two operations take the exact same
amount of time to run.

To look at the distance to a single point, just supply the index of that
vertex. To look at the distance to a set of points, supply a numpy array of
all of the vertices in the area. In the case of a set of points, the
geodesic distance measure will return the minimum distance to the set of
points as a whole.

The two hemispheres must be run separately.
