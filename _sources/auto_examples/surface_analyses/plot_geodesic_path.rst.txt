=======================
Plotting Geodesic Paths
=======================

This will plot a geodesic path between two vertices on the cortical surface.
This path is based on geodesic distances across the surface. The path starts
at the given endpoint and selects the neighbor of that point in the surface
map that is closest to the other endpoint. This process continues iteratilvely
until the last vertex in the path is the endpoint you gave to it.

All you need to do is supply a surface object and two vertices on that surface
and you can find the geodesic path. This script additionally makes a plot to
show all of the vertices listed in the path.
