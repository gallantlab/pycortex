        "\n# Plotting Geodesic Distances\n\nThis plots the distances (in mm) between a vertex or set of vertices and\nall other vertices on a surface. These two operations take the exact same\namount of time to run.\n\nTo look at the distance to a single point, just supply the index of that\nvertex. To look at the distance to a set of points, supply a numpy array of\nall of the vertices in the area. In the case of a set of points, the\ngeodesic distance measure will return the minimum distance to the set of\npoints as a whole.\n\nThe two hemispheres must be run separately.\n"
