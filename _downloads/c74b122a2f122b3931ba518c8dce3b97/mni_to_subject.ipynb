        "\n# Transform from MNI to Subject Space\n\n\nPycortex has built-in functionality for linearly transforming data to and from\nstandard atlas spaces (e.g. MNI-152). This functionality is built on top of FSL.\n\nThis example shows how to create a transform from some subject functional space\nto MNI space (the same as in subject_to_mni.py), and how to use that to put data\ninto subject space from MNI space.\n"
