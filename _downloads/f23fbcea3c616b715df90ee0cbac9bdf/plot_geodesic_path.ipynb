        "\n# Plotting Geodesic Paths\n\nThis will plot a geodesic path between two vertices on the cortical surface.\nThis path is based on geodesic distances across the surface. The path starts\nat the given endpoint and selects the neighbor of that point in the surface\nmap that is closest to the other endpoint. This process continues iteratilvely\nuntil the last vertex in the path is the endpoint you gave to it.\n\nAll you need to do is supply a surface object and two vertices on that surface\nand you can find the geodesic path. This script additionally makes a plot to\nshow all of the vertices listed in the path.\n"
