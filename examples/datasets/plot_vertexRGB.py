====================
Plot RGB Vertex Data
====================

This plots example RGB vertex data onto an example subject, S1, onto a flatmap
using quickflat. In order for this to run, you have to have a flatmap for this
subject in the pycortex filestore.

The cortex.VertexRGB object is instantiated with three cortex.Vertex objects,
one for each of the three color channels. Ideally, the data in the Volume
objects will be scaled to be between 0-255 and be np.uint8 type.

Here, two datasets are generated to look like gradients across the brain and
a third dataset makes a series of random stripes across the brain. You can
use any cortex.Vertex objects in their place though.
