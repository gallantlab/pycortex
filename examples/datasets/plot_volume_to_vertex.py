==============================
Map from Volume to Vertex Data
==============================

In order to move from Volume data to Vertex data, you start with data from
voxels and then create a cortex.Volume object. Then, you get a mapper to go
between voxels and vertices for the specific subject and transform you are
working with. Pass the voxel volume through the mapper and you get out a
vertex mapping of that data. You can plot both of these as you normally would.
