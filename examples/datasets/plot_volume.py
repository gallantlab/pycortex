================
Plot Volume Data
================

This plots example volume data onto an example subject, S1, onto a flatmap
using quickflat. In order for this to run, you have to have a flatmap for
this subject in the pycortex filestore.

The cortex.Volume object is instantiated with a numpy array of the same size
as the scan for this subject and transform. Instead of the random test data,
you can replace this with any numpy array of the correct dimensionality.

By changing the parameters vmin and vmax, you get thresholded data, as shown
in the colorbar for the figure.

If you have NaN values within your array, those voxels show up transparent
on the brain.
