===================
Interpolate Data
===================

In this example we show how to interpolate data from a sparse collection of points
to all the points in the cortical surface.

The method used here is biharmonic interpolation, which finds the solution with
the minimum squared Laplacian (fourth derivative) that still passes through all
the selected points. This is similar to thin plate splines.
