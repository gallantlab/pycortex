==================
Flatmap Distortion
==================

Creating a flatmap from a folded cortical surface always introduces some
distortion. This is similar to what happens when a map of the globe is flattened
into a 2-D map like a Mercator projection. For the cortical surface the amount
and type of distortion will depend on the curvature of the surface (i.e. whether
it is on a gyrus or a sulcus) and on the distance to the nearest cut.

In general, we recommend examining data both in flattened and original 3-D space
using the interactive webGL viewer, but it is also informative to visualize the
distortion directly.

Here we demonstrate how to compute and display both areal distortion, which is a
measure of how different the area of each triangle in the flattened mesh is from
its area in the original mesh, and metric distortion, which is a measure of how
different the length of each edge in the flattened mesh is from its length in
the original.

# Distortion class

# load fiducial (mid-cortical) surfaces

# the polys (triangles) are the same for the fiducial and flat surfaces
(lfidpts, lpolys), _ = cortex.db.get_surf(subject, "fiducial")

# this returns an array of values for each vertex, which we will put into
# a Vertex object for plotting

# areal distortion is in log_2 units (e.g. -1 is half the area, 1 is double)

cortex.quickshow(areal_dist, with_rois=False, with_labels=False)


# Next compute metric distortion
metric_dist = cortex.Vertex(dist.metric, subject, vmin=-2, vmax=2)
# metric distortion is in mm (e.g. -1 means flatmap edge is 1 mm shorter)

cortex.quickshow(metric_dist, with_rois=False, with_labels=False)


# Both of these distortion metrics can also be fetched easily via the pycortex
# database

# these also return Vertex objects like those we created above
