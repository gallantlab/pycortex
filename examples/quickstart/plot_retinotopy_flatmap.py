Plot Example Retinotopy Flatmaps
================================

This demo shows how to plot example retinotopy data onto a subject's brain
on a flatmap. In order for this demo to work, you need to download this
dataset_, but that can also be done automatically through the `urllib`
command that is included.


.. _dataset: http://gallantlab.org/pycortex/S1_retinotopy.hdf

S1 is the example subject that comes with pycortex, but if you want to plot
data onto a different subject, you will need to have them in your filestore,
and you will also need a flatmap for them.
